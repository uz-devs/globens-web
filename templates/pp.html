<h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
<p>
    <i><strong>COVID-19: Community Guidelines Updates and Protections:</strong> As people around the world confront this unprecedented public health emergency, we want to make sure that our Community Guidelines protect people from harmful content and new types of abuse related to COVID-19.
        <br>
        We're working to remove content that has the potential to contribute to real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm.
        <br>
        As the situation evolves, we continue to look at content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.</i>

    <br>
    <br>
    In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines â€“ if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.

        <strong>Share only photos and videos that you've taken or have the right to share.</strong>
        As always, you own the content you post on Globens.
        Remember to post authentic content, and don't post anything you've copied or collected from the Internet that you don't have the right to post.

    <li>
        <strong>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.</strong>
        We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity on Globens.
        This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks.
        It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest are allowed.
        Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.
        People like to share photos or videos of their children.
        For safety reasons, there are times when we may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children.
        Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways.
        You can learn more on our Tips for Parents page.
